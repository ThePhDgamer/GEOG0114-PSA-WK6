## **1.1. Let's begin**
In previous sessions, we investigated the presence of spatial autocorrelation in data using **Moran I's test** and in spatial
lag and error models. Today, we will learn how to do this through **semivariogram** analysis which can be used to create continuous predictive maps based on spatial interpolation using **Kriging**. In this session, we will investigate spatial variation in outcomes that are, in theory, **spatially continuous**; for example, the concentrations of ambient air pollutants such as Sulphur dioxide ($SO_{2}$) 
(a toxic gas emitted from sulphur rich fuels (i.e., coal, oil or diesel) when burnt) which can be present anywhere but in practice 
are only measured in specified point locations, such as air quality monitoring stations.

We will assess for the presence of spatial autocorrelation, which describes the correlation of a variable with itself through
geographic space. Here, a **Positive Autocorrelation** exists when measurements close to one another are alike than they 
would be due to chance or through random sampling. The presence of autocorrelation for spatially continuous phenomena can
be established using **semivariograms**.

Estimation from model semivariograms can be used to **interpolate** across a study area, whereby values at unsampled locations
are predicted from neighbouring sites. A popular form of interpolation, which is based on the spatial attribute's outcome
variable, is known as Kriging (a technique named after a South African engineer, Danie G. Krige (1919 to 2013)).

**OBJECTIVES**: The US Environmental Agency have position air quality monitors for surveillance of over 100 different types pollutants that exist as toxic gases, particulates and heavy metals. For **Sulphur Dioxide** ($SO_{2}$), there are 458 active air 
monitors that takes hourly readings for concentrations of $SO_{2}$ (in parts per billion (pbb)) . An annual estimate for $SO_{2}$ was calculated for each station at its location. Car usage, alongside of other anthropogenic activities such as coal burning, across the USA increases the risk of elevated pollution of $SO_{2}$.

Using geostatistical methods and taking into account of car usage - what areas in USA have higher concentrations of $SO_{2}$ exceeding the annual average of 40 ppb which a national safety limit for cause of concern?

## **1.2. Datasets & setting up the work directory** 
Before you begin do make sure to download all data from [**Moodle**](https://moodle.ucl.ac.uk). If you are working from 
a UCL workstation, do create a folder called "**Week 6**" within your "**GEOG0114**" folder stored in the N-drive.

Extract all data from the zip folder and stored into "**Week 6**" folder. Open a new R script and set the work directory 
to Week 6's folder (i.e., **Home (N:) > GEOG0114 > Week 6**)

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# Set working directory to Week 6 folder
setwd("N:/GEOG0114/Week 6")
```

</br>

## **1.3. Loading and installing packages**

We will need to load the following packages:

- `sf`: Simple Features
- `tmap`: Thematic Mapping
- `raster`: Raster/gridded data analysis and manipulation
- `sp`: Package for providing classes for spatial data (points, lines, polygons and grids)

```{r, message = FALSE, warning= FALSE}
# Load packages using library() function
library("sf")
library("tmap")
library("raster")
library("sp")
```

```{r, include = FALSE}
library("gstat")
```

The above packages `sf`, `tmap`, `raster` & `sp`  should have been installed in the previous session(s). We will need to 
install the following package:

- `gstat`: provides functions for univariable and multivariable geostatistical analysis.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# Install the packages: gstat using the install.package()
install.packages("gstat")

# Load the packages with library()
library("gstat")
```

</br>

## **1.4. Loading datasets**

Let us first import the quantitative data i.e., `US 2019 SO2 Emissions data.csv` into R/RStudio.

```{r, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
# Use read.csv() to import 
datafile <- read.csv(file = "US 2019 SO2 Emissions data.csv", header = TRUE, sep = ",")
```

**NOTE**: The description of the column names are as follows:

**Column Name** | **Description**
------------ | -------------
`CountyRef` | The County & State for where the air quality monitors are located in US
`Longitude` | Longitude (in decimal degrees)
`Latitude` | Latitude (in decimal degrees)
`Mean_SO2` | Annual Mean (ppb) concentrations of Ambient sulphur dioxide ($SO_{2}$) in 2019 
`CarIndex` | Proportion of households within a census tract that own at least 2 cars 
|
- US National border shape file: `US Nation Border.shp`
- US State border shape file: `US State Borders.shp`

```{r}
# Use read_sf() function to load shape file 
US_Nation_Border_shp <- st_read("US Nation Border.shp")
US_State_Border_shp <- st_read("US State Borders.shp")
```

</br>

## **1.5. Data preparation**
There are a couple of things we need to do before proceeding with the analysis: 

1. The `datafile` is a data frame object in RStudio's memory, and not a spatial object. We need to coerce into a spatial `sf` object
2. The shapefiles for `US Nation Border.shp` & `US State Borders.shp` are in a different CRS called **Spherical Mercator 3857**
which measures distance in meters and not in decimal degrees. We need to transform the `longitude` and `latitude` of our stations
which are in decimal degrees to the CRS of **Spherical Mercator 3857**

```{r}
# Coerce the spreadsheet into a sf object
# First tell R that itâ€™s coordinates are currently in decimal degrees (i.e., WGS84 'crs = 4326') before the transformation
datafile_sf <- st_as_sf(datafile, coords = c("Longitude", "Latitude"), crs = 4326)
# Now apply the transformation from WGS84 to Mercator i.e., = 3857
datafile_sf_prj <- st_transform(datafile_sf, 3857)
# Inspect the details
st_crs(datafile_sf_prj)
```

The code chunk below generates an empty map with the `tmap` functions. It shows just the border of USA and the point
locations for the air quality monitoring stations superimposed.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
tm_shape(US_Nation_Border_shp) + tm_polygons(alpha = 0, border.col = "black") + 
	tm_shape(datafile_sf_prj) + tm_dots() + 
	tm_scale_bar(position = c("left","bottom")) +
	tm_compass(position = c("right", "bottom"))
```
