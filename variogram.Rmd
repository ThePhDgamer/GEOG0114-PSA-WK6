## **2.1. Semivariogram analysis**
Semivariograms describe how data are related with distance by plotting the **semivariance** against the **separation distance**, known as the **experimental** or **empirical semivariogram**. The semivariance is defined as half the average squared difference between points separated by some distance _h_. As the separation distance _h_ between samples increase, we would expect the semivariance to also increase (again, because near samples are more similar than distant samples).

In the generic semivariogram shown above, there are three important parameters: 

1. **Sill**: The maximum semivariance value observed, and it indicates the threshold for values beyond (i.e., flatline) which
there is no spatial autocorrelation. **NOTE**: the **Partial Sill** is a value calculated by taking the difference between 
the **Sill** and **Nugget** (i.e., **Partial Sill = Sill - Nugget**)
2. **Range**: The maximum separation distance _h_ at which we will expect to find evidence of spatial autocorrelation. A 
separation distance beyond the **range** samples are no longer correlated. 
3. **Nugget**: This describes the variance of the measurement error combined with spatially uncorrelated variations at distances
shorter than the sample spacing, namely noise in the data. The larger the **nugget** relative to the **sill**, the less spatial 
dependence there is in the data and less useful Kriging will be.

<p class="comment">
**IMPORTANT NOTES**: Two important assumptions of a basic semivariogram are that the spatial process under investigation are: i.)
**stationary**, i.e., the spatial autocorrelation between the measurements of same variables in a given area is the same for all
locations; and ii.) **isotropic**, spatial autocorrelation is the same in every direction. If the autocorrelation differs by direction, it is termed as **anisotropic**.
</p>

To be used in Kriging, a semivariogram plot (akin to the above image) must be generated to estimate the 3 parameters (i.e., sill, nugget & range) from the points termed **experimental** or **empirical semivariogram**. These are used as initial values to fit a **modelled** or **theoretical semivariogram** which can be in one of three major forms:
1. Gaussian Model (Left)
2. Spherical Model (Center)
3. Exponential Model (Right)

Once the modelled semivariogram has been defined, it can be used in Kriging.

## **2.2. Plotting the Empirical Semivariogram**
Use the function `variogram()` to create the object for plotting the empirical variogram

```{r, message=FALSE,warning=FALSE}
# coerce datafile_sf_prj to be a 'sp' spatial dataframe object as it variogram does not use 'sf' objects
# ignore warning message
datafile_sp_prj <- as(datafile_sf_prj, "Spatial")
# use variogram() function to compute the semivariance with a null model Mean_SO2 as outcome
SO2_emp.variogram <- variogram(Mean_SO2~1, datafile_sp_prj)
# Compute the object to reveal a table
SO2_emp.variogram
```

<p class="comment">
**IMPORTANT NOTES**: `np` in the output is the number of paired considered within the separation distance `dist`; `gamma` is the averaged semivariance for the number of paired points within the separation distance `dist`.
</p>

</br> 

Let us plot these values to see the empirical semivariogram
``` {r, eval = FALSE}
plot(SO2_emp.variogram)
```

</center>

From the output (i.e., plot and table), we should note the approximate values for the `partial sill`, `nugget` and `range`. 
1. The `nugget` is roughly **17** (i.e. base on starting `gamma` value from the table).
2. The `range` is roughly **1180000** meters (i.e. base on peak value for `gamma` and it's corresponding `dist`).
3. The `partial sill` is **65**. This is derived from the peak value for `gamma` subtracted by the `nugget` (`82 - 17 = 65`).

These initial values give us an idea of what to expect when we proceed to fit a **theoretical** semivariogram using the `fit.variogram()`. It will help us to generate the fitted models.

</br>

## **2.3. Plotting the Theoretical Semivariogram**
We are going to fit a model to the empirical semivariogram in order to determine the appropriate function for Kriging (i.e., spherical (`Sph`), exponential (`Exp`) or gaussian (`Gau`)). 

We will start fitting the various models:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# Fit exponential
exp_SO2_emp.variogram <- fit.variogram(SO2_emp.variogram, model = vgm(65, "Exp", 1180000, 17))
exp_SO2_emp.variogram
plot(SO2_emp.variogram, exp_SO2_emp.variogram, main  = "Exponential model (Nug: 3.6, PSill: 55.9, Range: 296255m)")
```

<center>
!["/Users/anwarmusah/Documents/GITHUB/GEOG0114-PSA-WK6/GEOG0114-PSA-WK6"](Image2_3.png)
</center>

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# Fit Spherical
sph_SO2_emp.variogram <- fit.variogram(SO2_emp.variogram, model = vgm(65, "Sph", 1180000, 17))
sph_SO2_emp.variogram
plot(SO2_emp.variogram, sph_SO2_emp.variogram, main  = "Spherical model (Nug: 10.5, PSill: 49.6, Range: 857452m)")
```

<center>
!["/Users/anwarmusah/Documents/GITHUB/GEOG0114-PSA-WK6/GEOG0114-PSA-WK6"](Image2_4.png)
</center>

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# Fit gaussian
gau_SO2_emp.variogram <- fit.variogram(SO2_emp.variogram, model = vgm(65, "Gau", 1180000, 17))
gau_SO2_emp.variogram
plot(SO2_emp.variogram, gau_SO2_emp.variogram, main  = "Gaussian model (Nug: 12.8, PSill: 39.1, Range: 244807m)")
```

<center>
!["/Users/anwarmusah/Documents/GITHUB/GEOG0114-PSA-WK6/GEOG0114-PSA-WK6"](Image2_5.png)
</center>

By eyeballing the images - it difficult to discern whether the exponential or spherical model provides a better fit to the empirical semivariogram. We can use the `fit.variogram()` function to determine which is the best model amongst them. 

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# select the best model
best_SO2_emp.variogram <- fit.variogram(SO2_emp.variogram, model = vgm(c("Exp", "Gau", "Sph")))
best_SO2_emp.variogram
```

From the output (see column which says `model` and `row 2` it highlights `"Exp"`), it shows that the exponential model is the best fit with a `nugget = 3.6`, `Partial Sill =  55.9` and `Range = 296255m`. We therefore select the exponential model in our Kriging to make the spatial prediction for $SO_{2}$. Lets proceed to Krige.

<p class="comment">
**IMPORTANT NOTES**: The interpretation is as follows: the `nugget` in the exponential model is smaller than the other proposed models. It is small which is also an indication of evidence of larger spatial dependence in the concentrations for $SO_{2}$ across sampling sites in USA; A separation distance with values beyond `296255m` (where it curve starts to plateau) and beyond the semivariance's threshold where it flat lines (sill of `59.5` (i.e., `55.9 + 3.6`)) - there should expect that the spatial autocorrelation in the observed levels of $SO_{2}$ are not present anymore.
